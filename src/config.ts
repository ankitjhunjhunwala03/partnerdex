 * Every organization named by the environment, in priority order. May be empty.
 *
 * This list is the **seed**, not the answer. Organizations live in the
 * `organizations` table now; `getDb()` inserts anything here that the table does
 * not already have, and the table wins from then on — see
 * `seedOrganizationsFromEnv`. Everything that opens a Partner endpoint reads
 * `activeOrgs()`, never this.
 *
 * Empty is legal, and that is the change an existing deployment cannot see but a
 * new one depends on: an install with no secrets set has to boot far enough to
 * serve the page you add an organization on. The old refusal — "Missing required
 * environment variable PARTNER_ORGANIZATION_ID" at `getConfig()` — has moved to
 * where the question can actually be answered, which is after the table has been
 * consulted. `requireOrgs()` in the sync raises it there, with the same advice.
 *
 * Two forms, and they **combine** rather than override, because the combination
 * is the migration path:
 *
 *   1. `PARTNER_ORGANIZATION_ID` + `PARTNER_API_TOKEN` — the original pair.
 *      Still supported, still first in the list, still the source of the same
 *      error message when nothing at all is configured. An existing deployment
 *      changes no variable it already has.
 *   2. `PARTNER_ORG_<n>_ID` + `PARTNER_ORG_<n>_TOKEN` (+ optional
 *      `PARTNER_ORG_<n>_LABEL`) for any positive integer n.
 *
 * So adding a second organization to a running instance is exactly two new
 * secrets and nothing removed — `fly secrets set PARTNER_ORG_2_ID=...
 * PARTNER_ORG_2_TOKEN=...`. Indexed variables rather than one
 * `PARTNER_ORGS="id:token,id:token"` list for three reasons: `fly secrets set`
 * takes one name-value pair at a time, so rotating org B's token would
 * otherwise mean re-pasting org A's; a token is never a substring of a larger
 * value that some log line might print whole; and there is no delimiter for a
 * token to collide with.
 *
 * The indices are *scanned*, not counted up from 1, so deleting
 * `PARTNER_ORG_2_*` and leaving `PARTNER_ORG_3_*` in place drops one org
 * instead of silently dropping two.
 *
 * Order matters beyond cosmetics: `orgs[0]` is what the `apps.org_id` migration
 * backfills existing rows to. With the legacy pair present it is the legacy
 * org, which is by definition the only org those rows can have come from.
