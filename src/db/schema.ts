/**
 * The SQLite schema, applied idempotently on every open.
 *
 * Four roles, one file (the Partner API's volume comfortably fits SQLite):
 *   1. raw feeds        — `app_events`, `transactions` as returned by the API,
 *                         and `listing_events` as exported by GA4
 *   2. derived indexes  — `subscriptions`, `install_intervals`, normalized at
 *                         write time so read-time math is sums + date compares
 *   3. operational      — `sync_state`, `metric_cache`, `drift_snapshots`
 *   4. durable          — `notification_channels` and the two tables that decide
 *                         what has already been said and to whom; `app_reviews`,
 *                         which holds the only surviving copy of a review once
 *                         the App Store stops serving it; and the BigQuery
 *                         connection, whose credential nothing else can supply
 *
 * Roles 1 and 2 are disposable: both are rebuilt from the API on demand. Role 4
 * is the only place in this store holding state that cannot be recovered by
 * re-syncing, which is why its tables are written to rather than rebuilt.
 *
 * Every timestamp column holds a canonical UTC ISO-8601 string, so lexical
 * comparison is chronological comparison and the as-of predicate is plain SQL.

-- that predates it alike, so there is no version of this file where a column
-- here exists on one and not the other. \`migrate()\` therefore has nothing to add

--
-- \`token\` holds a live Partner API credential in plaintext. That is a decision
-- with a written case behind it, and the case is in \`src/orgs/store.ts\` —
-- including what it does not protect against. The property enforced in code is

-- The subscription-side rollups.
--
-- \`transaction_daily\` above rolls up a *flow*: a day's row is a sum of things
-- that happened inside the day, and a window is a sum of days. MRR is not that.
-- It is a *stock* — "which subscriptions were live at this instant" — and a
-- stock is not a sum of anything, so the same table shape cannot carry it.
--
-- A stock's rollup is therefore a snapshot rather than a subtotal: one row per
-- day recording the population as it stood at the instant that day opened. The
-- two tables below are those snapshots. Their day keys mean the same thing
-- \`transaction_daily\`'s do — a calendar date in REPORTING_TIMEZONE — but the
-- row is read at \`dayKeyStart(day)\` instead of summed over \`[day, day+1)\`.
--
-- The consequence, which is the whole design: a snapshot can only answer an
-- instant it actually holds. Bucket boundaries are local midnights, so the
-- interior boundaries of every window land exactly on a snapshot; the final
-- bucket ends at *now*, which does not, and falls back to the raw tables. See
-- \`metrics/stockRollup.ts\`.

-- The live subscription population at the midnight opening \`day\`.
--
-- \`gate\` is the as-of flag that cannot be answered by summing columns, so the
-- table keys on it instead. \`includeTrials\` swaps the predicate's gate from the
-- first paid charge to activation, which selects a *different population* — not
-- a superset and not a subset of the other, since a subscription's two gate
-- instants can straddle any given midnight. Two rows per day is the honest
-- shape; one row plus an adjustment would be a rollup that quietly answers one
-- flag combination when asked about another.
--   0 = gated on conversion_at (includeTrials = false)
--   1 = gated on activated_at  (includeTrials = true)
--
-- \`includeAnnual\`, by contrast, *is* answerable by columns, because it is a
-- filter on a row attribute rather than a change of predicate: the annual and
-- non-annual halves are stored apart and the reader adds the ones it wants.
--
-- Subscriber counts are stored twice for the reason the split cannot cover:
-- \`COUNT(DISTINCT shop)\` is not additive across the annual/non-annual split.
-- One shop holding both an annual and a monthly charge is one subscriber in the
-- total and would be two if the halves were added. It *is* additive across
-- \`app_id\`, because a subscriber is a shop-and-app pair, so no third column is
-- needed for the per-app scopes.

-- Shopify or the merchant takes one down it is gone from the listing forever, so

-- deleted — removal is recorded, not applied.
--
-- \`review_id\` is Shopify's own id from the listing markup, which is what makes
-- re-crawling idempotent, removal detectable, and the notification ledger able
-- to promise a review is announced exactly once.
--
-- \`removed_at\` is set when a full sweep completes without seeing the review
-- again. It deliberately does not say *who* removed it: a Shopify purge, a
-- merchant deleting their own review, and a closed store are indistinguishable
-- from outside, and a column implying otherwise would be inventing a fact.
--
-- \`content_hash\` covers the fields a merchant can edit (rating and body). A
-- change means the review was rewritten rather than replaced, which is a
-- different piece of news from a new review arriving.
--
-- \`shop_id\` is the link to the Customers page, and it is a guess. Reviews carry
-- the merchant's *store name* and never the myshopify domain, so the match runs
-- against \`shops.name\` and is only trusted when exactly one shop that actually
-- installed the app answers to that name. \`match_method\` records how the link
