/**
 * The SQLite schema, applied idempotently on every open.
 *
 * Four roles, one file (the Partner API's volume comfortably fits SQLite):
 *   1. raw feeds        — `app_events`, `transactions` as returned by the API,
 *                         and `listing_events` as exported by GA4
 *   2. derived indexes  — `subscriptions`, `install_intervals`, normalized at
 *                         write time so read-time math is sums + date compares
 *   3. operational      — `sync_state`, `metric_cache`, `drift_snapshots`
 *   4. durable          — `notification_channels` and the two tables that decide
 *                         what has already been said and to whom; `app_reviews`,
 *                         which holds the only surviving copy of a review once
 *                         the App Store stops serving it; and the BigQuery
 *                         connection, whose credential nothing else can supply
 *   5. affiliate ledger — the `affiliate_*` cluster: who refers merchants, which
 *                         merchant each one referred, and what that has earned
 *
 * Roles 1 and 2 are disposable: both are rebuilt from the API on demand. Roles 4
 * and 5 hold the state that cannot be recovered by re-syncing, which is why
 * their tables are written to rather than rebuilt.
 *
 * Every timestamp column holds a canonical UTC ISO-8601 string, so lexical
 * comparison is chronological comparison and the as-of predicate is plain SQL.

-- that predates it alike, so there is no version of this file where a column
-- here exists on one and not the other. \`migrate()\` therefore has nothing to add

--
-- \`token\` holds a live Partner API credential in plaintext. That is a decision
-- with a written case behind it, and the case is in \`src/orgs/store.ts\` —
-- including what it does not protect against. The property enforced in code is

-- The subscription-side rollups.
--
-- \`transaction_daily\` above rolls up a *flow*: a day's row is a sum of things
-- that happened inside the day, and a window is a sum of days. MRR is not that.
-- It is a *stock* — "which subscriptions were live at this instant" — and a
-- stock is not a sum of anything, so the same table shape cannot carry it.
--
-- A stock's rollup is therefore a snapshot rather than a subtotal: one row per
-- day recording the population as it stood at the instant that day opened. The
-- two tables below are those snapshots. Their day keys mean the same thing
-- \`transaction_daily\`'s do — a calendar date in REPORTING_TIMEZONE — but the
-- row is read at \`dayKeyStart(day)\` instead of summed over \`[day, day+1)\`.
--
-- The consequence, which is the whole design: a snapshot can only answer an
-- instant it actually holds. Bucket boundaries are local midnights, so the
-- interior boundaries of every window land exactly on a snapshot; the final
-- bucket ends at *now*, which does not, and falls back to the raw tables. See
-- \`metrics/stockRollup.ts\`.

-- The live subscription population at the midnight opening \`day\`.
--
-- \`gate\` is the as-of flag that cannot be answered by summing columns, so the
-- table keys on it instead. \`includeTrials\` swaps the predicate's gate from the
-- first paid charge to activation, which selects a *different population* — not
-- a superset and not a subset of the other, since a subscription's two gate
-- instants can straddle any given midnight. Two rows per day is the honest
-- shape; one row plus an adjustment would be a rollup that quietly answers one
-- flag combination when asked about another.
--   0 = gated on conversion_at (includeTrials = false)
--   1 = gated on activated_at  (includeTrials = true)
--
-- \`includeAnnual\`, by contrast, *is* answerable by columns, because it is a
-- filter on a row attribute rather than a change of predicate: the annual and
-- non-annual halves are stored apart and the reader adds the ones it wants.
--
-- Subscriber counts are stored twice for the reason the split cannot cover:
-- \`COUNT(DISTINCT shop)\` is not additive across the annual/non-annual split.
-- One shop holding both an annual and a monthly charge is one subscriber in the
-- total and would be two if the halves were added. It *is* additive across
-- \`app_id\`, because a subscriber is a shop-and-app pair, so no third column is
-- needed for the per-app scopes.

 * The affiliate ledger (role 5).
 *
 * Everything above this line is either a copy of something the Partner API will
 * hand back again or a function of such a copy. Nothing below it is. An
 * affiliate is a person we owe money to, an attribution is the claim that they
 * are owed it, and no API anywhere can be asked to re-state either — the
 * originals are being imported out of a platform that shuts down on 2026-08-14.
 *
 * So these tables are written to and never rebuilt, and in particular they are
 * invisible to \`rebuildDerivedTables()\`, which drops and rewrites its own
 * tables on every sync. Commission *amounts* are safe to recompute, because the
 * transactions they are computed from are re-fetchable; the attribution they
 * hang off, and the record that one was paid, are not.
 *
 * Deletion is soft throughout, for the same reason. \`deleted_at\` on an
 * attribution unassigns a merchant without destroying the evidence that they
 * were once assigned, which is what a disputed commission is argued from.
 *
 * The joins outward — \`shop_id\` to \`shops\`, \`app_id\` to \`apps\` — carry no
 * foreign key on purpose. Shopify shop and app ids are globally unique so the
 * join is exact, but an attribution can legitimately arrive before the sync has
 * ever seen the shop: the Mantle import lands its referrals against whatever
 * fraction of the shop table exists that day. A constraint there would turn a
 * known-good referral into an import failure, so the column is left blank and
 * \`myshopify_domain\` is kept beside it as the key a later pass re-resolves from.

-- is only known *after* the handle resolves. Two programs can share an app, so
-- a per-program window would mean two programs disagreeing about one click with
-- no principled tie-break. The parameter names and the host allowlist are
-- properties of the tracking setup, not of anybody's terms.
--
-- Every default here is exactly the constant it replaced, so a database that
-- has never opened this screen behaves identically to one from before it
-- existed.

-- three columns on the commissions they settled — enough to answer "was this

-- question an affiliate asks when a number on their statement is unfamiliar.
--
-- Role 5 and durable for the same reason as everything else in this cluster: no
-- API will restate that money left the building. Deletion is soft.
--
-- \`status\` carries Mantle's word for it, and there are exactly two in the data:
-- 'paid' (nearly all of them) and 'requested' (a single row, which Mantle shut
-- down before settling). It is descriptive, not a workflow — nothing here transitions
-- a payout, because nothing here pays one.
--
-- \`amount\` is what the payout was raised for and \`amount_paid\` is what the
-- payer recorded actually sending, NULL while unpaid. They are separate columns
-- rather than one because a payment that went out short is a discrepancy someone
-- has to see, and a single column would hide it by construction.
--
-- \`number\` is Mantle's human-facing reference (a contiguous range here) and is
-- what an affiliate quotes in an email. It is stored as text and never re-used as a key:
-- it is an outside system's counter, and ours starts wherever it starts.
--
-- \`period_start\`/\`period_end\` are the window the payout claimed to cover. They
-- are Mantle's own bounds and are not always the extent of the commissions
-- actually attached — the link is \`affiliate_commissions.payout_id\`, and that,
-- not this window, is what the payout paid for.
-- \`program_id\` is nullable, unlike everywhere else in this cluster, because a
-- handful of Mantle's payouts carry no program at all — they are the earliest
-- ones, the lowest reference numbers, raised before payouts were scoped to a
-- program. The import fills those in from the commissions they paid for, but
-- only where every
-- one of those commissions agrees on a single program, which is the difference
-- between reading the answer off the ledger and guessing it. NULL is what a
-- payout gets when they do not agree, and it means "not recorded", not "none".

/* --- affiliate attribution claims (role 5) -------------------------------- */

-- An affiliate asserting "this merchant was mine", waiting for a decision.
--
-- A request, not a fact, and the distinction is the whole table. Everything else
-- in this cluster records something that happened; this records something
-- somebody says happened and that nobody has ruled on yet. It therefore earns no
-- commission, appears in no balance, and is joined to by nothing in the
-- engine — a claim only ever becomes money by an operator approving it, which
-- writes an ordinary \`source='manual'\` row in \`affiliate_attributions\` through
-- the same path a hand assignment uses.
--
-- Hundreds of these were carried out of Mantle, and a pending queue of them is
-- still undecided.
-- They are imported *as pending*: the operator has deliberately not decided
-- them, and an import that inferred a decision would be making that call on
-- their behalf and silently moving money to do it.
--
-- \`status\` is stored, and in Mantle it was not — there it was derived from two
-- nullable timestamps, \`rejectedAt\` winning over \`approvedAt\`. Deriving it at
-- read time here would spread that precedence rule across every query that
-- filters on it, so it is resolved once on the way in and the timestamps are
-- kept beside it as the evidence.
--
-- \`shop_id\` may be blank, for exactly the reason it may be blank on an
-- attribution: the claim names a merchant by \`myshopify_domain\` and the Partner
-- API sync may not have reached them yet. \`resolveClaimShops()\` fills it in
-- later, and nothing here waits on it.
--
-- \`attribution_id\` is the referral this claim corresponds to, where one exists.
-- It is a link and never a creation: the imported ledger already holds a large
-- minority of manual attributions that these approvals almost certainly
-- produced, and pointing at them is what stops a re-import writing the same
-- referral twice.
-- Blank is a real and expected answer — an approval whose attribution was later
-- unassigned, or never made, has nothing to point at, and inventing one would be
-- this import deciding that a merchant belongs to somebody.
--
-- \`decided_by\` is free text and is the *name Mantle recorded*, not a local user:
-- this dashboard authenticates with one shared password and has no user table,
-- so there is no identity to resolve it against. A decision made here carries
-- whatever the operator chose to sign it with, or nothing.
