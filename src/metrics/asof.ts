 * about is one the snapshot holds — a local midnight, which is what every bucket
 * boundary except the last one is — and falls back to the raw scan for the rest.
 * `metrics/stockRollup.ts` is that rule; the raw halves below are unchanged.

 * Because the snapshot is rebuilt rather than adjusted, a backdated cancellation
