/**
 * Running the Mantle import, and saying what it did.
 *
 * This lives in `src/` rather than in `scripts/` for one blunt reason: the
 * production image is runtime-only. Its final stage copies `dist/`, production
 * `node_modules` and `package.json`, and runs `node dist/cli.js` — there is no
 * `scripts/` directory in it and no `tsx` to execute one with. An import that
 * exists only as a script is an import that cannot be run against the deployed
 * database, which is where the hundreds of affiliates actually have to end up.
 *
 * So the logic is here, `partnerdex import-affiliates` calls it, and the script
 * is a four-line wrapper kept for local use. Two callers, one copy — the other
 * arrangement drifts, and the copy that drifts is the one that writes the
 * ledger.
 *
 * Nothing in here decides anything the import does not already decide. It reads
 * the export, runs the import inside a transaction it may roll back, and formats
 * the result — because on a deployed machine that output is the only feedback
 * there is.
