/**
 * The one-way import out of Mantle.
 *
 * Three properties are worth more than everything else this file does:
 *
 * 1. **It is idempotent.** Every write goes through an upsert keyed on Mantle's
 *    own id, so the import can be run today against a half-synced shop table and
 *    again next week against a complete one. That is not a convenience — a first
 *    historical Partner API sync takes hours, and the platform being imported
 *    from shuts down on 2026-08-14. The two clocks do not line up, so the import
 *    has to be safe to repeat.
 *
 * 2. **Nothing is dropped silently.** A referral whose merchant is not in
 *    `shops` is still imported, with the domain kept and the shop left blank,
 *    and it is named in the report. The failure mode being designed against is
 *    an affiliate who is quietly owed nothing because a row went missing between
 *    two systems, which nobody would notice until they asked.
 *
 * 3. **Mantle's ids survive as `external_id`.** Every table here can be joined
 *    back to the export for as long as the export exists, which is what makes
 *    "did we import this correctly" a question with an answer.
 *
 * Commission *amounts* are imported as facts rather than recomputed. The engine
 * that recomputes them is a separate piece of work, and its whole validation
 * gate is a diff against every imported commission row — which requires having
 * them.

     * Attribution claims, last, and carried across exactly as they stand.
     *
     * A claim is an affiliate asserting a merchant was theirs, waiting for an
     * operator to rule on it. Hundreds of them exist, and the only rule this
     * import applies is Mantle's own: `rejectedAt` beats `approvedAt` beats neither.
     *
     * The undecided ones import as pending, and pending means pending. No
     * attribution is created for them, nothing they touch reaches the commission
     * engine, and nothing here reads their notes, their volume or who filed them.
     * The operator has deliberately not decided these; an import that inferred a
     * decision would be making that call for them and moving money to do it.
     *
     * Approvals are linked to the referral they correspond to rather than
     * producing a new one — see `linkClaimsToAttributions`, which also counts the
     * approvals that correspond to nothing. That count is a finding about what
     * Mantle held, not a gap for this import to fill.
