/**
 * Replaying Mantle's commission history through our own engine.
 *
 * This is the validation gate for workstream D: before any affiliate UI exists,
 * recompute every commission Mantle ever paid and diff it against the ledger.
 * Agreement is what earns the engine trust; disagreement is a finding, not a
 * rounding problem.
 *
 * Two independent passes, because they fail for different reasons and
 * conflating them would let one hide the other:
 *
 *   FORMULA pass  — feeds the engine the transactions embedded in Mantle's own
 *                   export. It tests the arithmetic and the rules against every
 *                   imported commission row with no join and no sync
 *                   dependency, so it is valid even when the local database is
 *                   empty or mid-sync.
 *
 *   PARTNER pass  — feeds the engine transactions from PartnerDex's `transactions`
 *                   table, joined to referrals through `myshopifyDomain`. This is
 *                   the real test, because it is the pipeline we will actually
 *                   run on: it can catch a charge Mantle recorded and we do not
 *                   see, and a charge we see and Mantle never paid on.
 *
 * The Partner pass is bounded by whatever the local sync has reached. It reports
 * that boundary rather than pretending to full coverage.
