/**
 * Self-signup: how somebody who is not yet an affiliate becomes one.
 *
 * Everything in the affiliate ledger until now arrived by import. There were
 * hundreds of partners and no way to become the next one, which is a program
 * that can only shrink. This is the front door, and it is the first place in this system where
 * an untrusted stranger writes a row.
 *
 * The rules it holds to, each of which has a way of being quietly wrong:
 *
 *   1. **Approval is read from the program, never assumed.** `require_approval`
 *      is a per-program column, and the difference is not cosmetic: an
 *      applicant to a program that requires approval becomes `pending` and gets
 *      no working link,
 *      because the attribution pipeline credits only `enrolled` memberships. An
 *      applicant handed a link they cannot earn from would promote it, send us
 *      real installs, and be paid nothing — a failure that is silent on both
 *      sides until somebody asks why a balance never moved. Which program needs
 *      approval is a column, so a third program can arrive without a code change
 *      and an operator flipping the flag takes effect immediately.
 *
 *   2. **One person is one affiliate row.** An existing affiliate applying to a
 *      second program attaches a membership to the account they already have.
 *      The alternative — a second `affiliates` row — splits their commissions
 *      across two balances that nothing joins back together, and the person is
 *      paid twice or half.
 *
 *   3. **A membership that already exists is never rewritten.** Including a
 *      rejected one. Re-applying must not be a way to walk around a decision an
 *      admin already made, and there are rejected memberships in the ledger
 *      today for whom that matters.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does *not* do: mint credentials, answer a
 * request, or decide what a stranger is told. Password setting reuses the
 * existing set-password token flow and the response shape is the router's
 * problem — see `src/server/signup.ts`, where the rule that signup must not
 * disclose whether an address is already ours actually lives.

 *
 * The read-then-write is safe here for a reason worth stating rather than
 * assuming, because "check then insert" is usually a race: `better-sqlite3` is
 * synchronous and this process has one connection, and every caller runs inside
 * the transaction in `applyForSignup`, so nothing can insert between the check
 * and the write. The unique index is still the actual guarantee — if that
 * reasoning ever stops holding, the insert fails loudly instead of minting a
 * duplicate link that would credit one affiliate's clicks to another.
 *
 * Note what this does not do: reuse the applicant's handle from another program.
 * The two imported affiliates who share one across programs are the reason
 * `destinationFor` has to guess which listing a click meant. New signups get a
 * distinct handle per program, so that ambiguity does not grow.
