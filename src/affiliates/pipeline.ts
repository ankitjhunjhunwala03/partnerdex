/**
 * The join between the three affiliate modules and the sync loop.
 *
 * `ga4Attribution.ts` discovers referrals and writes nothing. `commission.ts`
 * computes amounts and reads nothing. `store.ts` writes rows and decides
 * nothing. Each of those is deliberately incomplete — this file is where they
 * meet a clock, and it is the only place that knows the order the three have to
 * happen in:
 *
 *   1. attribute — new referrals, from GA4, incrementally
 *   2. resolve   — referrals whose merchant the sync had not met yet
 *   3. recompute — commissions, over every referral that now has a shop
 *
 * The order is not arbitrary. A referral with no `shop_id` earns nothing,
 * because the commission engine joins transactions on (app, shop); so resolving
 * has to happen after anything that can create a referral and before anything
 * that pays on one. Running recompute first would leave a merchant unpaid for a
 * whole sync interval for no reason other than sequencing.
 *
 * **Nothing here may fail the sync.** Affiliate attribution reads BigQuery,
 * which is optional in this product and unreachable in most installs. The
 * Partner API sync is the thing that must not break — it is where MRR comes
 * from — so every step below either returns a reason or is caught, exactly as
 * `syncListingEvents` does for the funnel.
 */

/**
 * How far back an incremental attribution run re-reads, in days of install.
 *
 * The same reasoning as `LOOKBACK_HOURS` in `bigquery/ingest.ts`: GA4 keeps
 * backfilling a daily table for hours after it first appears, so the newest day
 * is never complete when first read. Attribution has a second reason the funnel
 * does not — an attribution is a *pair*, and a click that lands late can be the
 * first touch for an install already seen. Re-deriving the tail is what lets
 * that correct itself.
 *
 * `ga4Attribution.ts` already picked 3 days for its own default; this re-exports
 * that decision rather than making a second one that could drift from it.

 * already claimed by someone else stays claimed. The pipeline re-reads its own
 * tail on every run and a late-arriving click can change what first touch says;
 * allowing that to move a referral would mean an affiliate's earnings could
 * change under them days after the fact, and any commission already computed
 * against the old owner would silently become someone else's. Where the two
 * disagree, the existing record wins and the disagreement is counted.
 *
 * **It never overwrites a human decision.** `source='manual'` is an admin who
 * looked at the case and assigned it; `source='imported'` is a fact carried out
 * of the platform this one replaces. GA4 is an inference. An inference does not
 * get to overrule either — a large minority of the imported referrals were
 * manual precisely because the automated path could not see them, so a pipeline
 * that
 * overwrote manual rows would spend its life undoing the fix for its own blind
 * spot.
 *
 * **It does not resurrect an unassignment.** A referral soft-deleted *after*
 * the click being offered is the same claim, already withdrawn — by an admin or
 * by the 30-day-after-uninstall rule. Re-creating it because the click is still
 * inside the lookback window would make the removal last exactly one sync
 * interval. A click that lands *after* the removal is a genuinely new referral
 * and is allowed through.
 *
 * What it does update, on a row it already owns, is the shop id and the click
 * date — the first so a merchant that has since synced stops being unresolved,
 * the second because an earlier click is a better answer under first touch.
