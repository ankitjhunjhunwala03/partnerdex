/**
 * Deciding which affiliate sent a merchant, from the GA4 export alone.
 *
 * The affiliate link is `apps.shopify.com/<listing>?mref=<handle>`. Nothing in
 * the Shopify app ever saw that parameter — it was never forwarded anywhere —
 * so the only place the handle exists is in the URL Google recorded when the
 * browser opened the listing. Attribution is therefore a join between two
 * things GA4 knows and nothing else does:
 *
 *   - a listing page whose `page_location` carries the referral parameter, and
 *     which identifies the visitor only as a `user_pseudo_id` — a cookie
 *   - a `shopify_app_install`, which is the one event in the export carrying
 *     `shop_url` and `shop_id`, and which carries the same `user_pseudo_id`
 *
 * The install event is the bridge. `src/bigquery/ingest.ts` deliberately skips
 * it, and is right to: the funnel wants installs, installs are already complete
 * and exact in the Partner API, and reading them from a cookie-dependent
 * browser event instead would make a solid number worse. Attribution wants
 * something different from the same event — not the fact of the install, which
 * it already has, but the single row in the whole export where a browser cookie
 * and a shop appear side by side. That is the only reason it is read here, and
 * the install timestamp it returns should be treated as GA4's account of the
 * install rather than the authoritative one.
 *
 * **The limitation this inherits.** GA4 counts browsers; the Partner API counts
 * shops. PartnerDex refuses to join across that seam anywhere else, on purpose.
 * Affiliate attribution is the one place that has to, and it pays the usual
 * price: a merchant who clicks the link on their phone and installs from their
 * laptop is two `user_pseudo_id`s and cannot be joined, and a merchant whose
 * browser blocks analytics never produces a click row at all. Both are missed
 * silently — they look exactly like an install nobody referred. Mantle had the
 * same limitation and the same blind spot; this is not a regression, and it is
 * why a manual attribution path has to exist alongside this one rather than
 * being treated as a stopgap.
 */

 * The click-to-install join.
 *
 * ### Cost
 *
 * These are years of daily tables and `events_*` with no suffix bound is a scan
 * of every day the property has ever recorded. Three things keep the bill down,
 * and all three are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. `_TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN` is always present and always bound. It is what
 *     turns a wildcard into a range scan; BigQuery prunes the other tables
 *     before reading a byte.
 *  2. Only four columns are touched — `event_name`, `user_pseudo_id`,
 *     `event_timestamp` and `event_params`. BigQuery bills for columns read, not
 *     rows, and `event_params` is by far the widest of the four. Adding one more
 *     nested field to the projection costs more than adding a month to the range.
 *  3. Both sides are read in one pass over one scan. Reading clicks and installs
 *     as two separate wildcard queries would double the bill for the same answer,
 *     because their date ranges overlap almost entirely.
 *
 * Dry-run against one app's `analytics_<ga4-property-id>` dataset on 2026-08-13:
 *
 * | scan | bytes |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | 3 days of installs, the default incremental run | 0.007 GB |
 * | 105 days — 75 of installs plus the 30-day click lookback | 0.138 GB |
 * | the entire multi-year export, a one-off backfill | 0.920 GB |
 *
 * A full-history backfill costs under a gigabyte and fits inside BigQuery's
 * monthly free tier on its own. Nothing here needs to be rationed; what it needs
 * is for the suffix bound to never go missing, which is why it is not optional
 * in the builder. The 20 GiB `maximumBytesBilled` ceiling in `client.ts` still
 * applies and would catch a bound that failed to bind.
 *
 * ### Shape
 *
 * The intraday tables are excluded by the same accident that excludes them from
 * the funnel: `events_intraday_20260813` sorts after every `YYYYMMDD`, so the
 * BETWEEN never reaches them. Today's installs are therefore attributable
 * tomorrow, which is also why the lookback overlap exists.
 *
 * The suffix range is padded by a day at each end and the exact bounds are then
 * applied to `event_timestamp`. GA4 dates its tables in the *property's*
 * timezone and stamps `event_timestamp` in UTC; without the padding, an install
 * just after local midnight on the first day of the window sits in the previous
 * day's table and is never read.

/**
 * Attribution across every app that has a GA4 dataset configured.

 * Returns plain objects and writes nothing. That is not an oversight: an
 * attribution is a durable fact about who is owed money, and the decision about
 * where it lands — and about what happens when a re-run disagrees with a row
 * already written — belongs with the schema that stores it, not with the query
 * that discovered it.
