/**
 * The cross-affiliate referral feed, and how it is obtained when the server
 * cannot answer for it.
 *
 * The admin API returns referrals one affiliate at a time. Every other affiliate
 * page is a straight read of an endpoint; this one is not, because "every
 * referral, filterable by source" has no route behind it. Rather than drop the
 * view — the source split is the point, a large minority of the imported
 * referrals were manual assignments and telling them apart is why an operator
 * opens it — the feed is assembled in the browser out of the per-affiliate records.
 *
 * Three things keep that honest rather than merely clever:
 *
 *   - **It is bounded and complete.** Every affiliate is read once — hundreds of
 *     requests against an indexed local store, answered in well under a second
 *     — rather than only the ones the list says currently hold a referral,
 *     which would silently drop every referral that has been unassigned.
 *   - **It is cached for the session**, so moving between Referrals and
 *     Programs — which needs the same figures per program — costs nothing the
 *     second time. Assigning or unassigning a merchant clears it.
 *   - **It says so.** The page shows how it was built and how many records it
 *     read, so nobody mistakes a client-side assembly for a server-side report.
 *
 * The moment `GET /api/affiliates/referrals` exists, `fetchReferralFeed` answers
 * and the fallback is never reached.
