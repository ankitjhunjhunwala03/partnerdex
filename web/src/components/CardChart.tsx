/**
 * Everything on a metric card that needs the charting library, behind one
 * default export so the card can `lazy()` it.
 *
 * The split is worth a file of its own for two reasons. The charting library is
 * by some distance the largest thing the dashboard ships, and most of the
 * dashboard never draws a chart at all — the customer list, the settings pages
 * and the whole affiliate section are tables and forms, and used to pay for a
 * plotting library to render them. And on the pages that do draw charts, the
 * figure and its comparison are the part a reader looks at first: they paint
 * from the card's own module while the plot underneath them is still arriving.
